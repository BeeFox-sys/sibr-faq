# The Grand List of Minor Mysteries

In no particular order, these are the things that SIBR wants to know, but currently doesn't.

- Is the `tragicness` rating from an incineration replacement player determined by anything? Is it correlated with the incinerated player's statistics?
- Does team performance change drastically after their players are incinerated?
- Do allergic/yummy peanut reactions drastically change outcomes?
  - Is this obviously related to `peanutAllergy`?
- How are the presented betting odds calculated?
- How are team match-ups determined, if they aren't random?
- What is `cinnamon`?
- What is `fate`?
- What is `totalFingers`?
  - The going theory on this is that fingers are used as a measure of how "mutant" a player is.
