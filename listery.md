# The Grand List of Minor Mysteries

In no particular order, these are the things that SIBR wants to know, but currently doesn't.

- Is the `tragicness` rating from an incineration replacement player determined by anything? Is it correlated with the incinerated player's statistics?
- Does team performance change drastically after their players are incinerated?
- Do allergic/yummy peanut reactions drastically change outcomes?
  - Is this obviously related to `peanutAllergy`?
- How are the presented betting odds calculated?
- How are team match-ups determined, if they aren't random?
- What is `cinnamon`?
- What is `fate`?
- What is `totalFingers`?
  - The going theory on this is that fingers are used as a measure of how "mutant" a player is.
- How much effect did the *Fourth Strike* have for teams blessed with it?
- How well did the total stars (or pitching stars or lineup stars) correlate with team overall performance? Which teams over- or under-performed?
  - Which players over- or under-performed their star rating?
