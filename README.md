# SIBRFAQ
A list of Frequently Asked Questions for SIBR: the Society for Internet Blaseball Research

## What does SIBR do?

The Society peeks behind the curtain of Blaseball. We archive game data and work on projects to display and analyze that data. Often, as part of our work, we dive deeper into how Blaseball works and try to analyze what consequences our actions will have.

## How do I pronounce SIBR?

It's pronounced "SIBR"

## What are the API endpoints?

## Is there a script to vote/bet/etc?

The Society does not condone using the API for anything that requires authentication and may affect a user's account. We only handle read-only data.

## Is anyone keeping track of game updates?

https://github.com/iliana/blaseball-archive-scripts

iliana is running this script locally, and we hope to have it productionized soon. Archives of game update logs can be found in the pinned messages of #archivism.

## Is there an API for historical data?

We're working on it. You can monitor the process in #archiving and #modeling.

## I'm new, what can I do to contribute?

It depends on which kind of genius you are.
If you're a coding genius, you can check the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KqiT4fms/society-for-internet-blaseball-research-projects), if you're more of a number cruncher, take a look at the [Grand List of Minor Mysteries](https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/sibr-faq/blob/master/listery.md).

# ⚠️ FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE ZONE ⚠️

The Society (along with the Wiki) classify any information not visible on blaseball.com as "Forbidden Knowledge", to allow people playing Blaseball to decide whether they want to cross that threshold themselves.

When discussing Forbidden Knowledge, please use spoiler tags in the main Blaseball Discord (surround your text with double pipes `||`).
